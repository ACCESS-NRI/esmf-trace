# Workspace environment for ACCESS profiling and scaling workflows.
#
# This file installs multiple ACCESS repos into a single virtual
# environment for convenient imports and interactive development.
#
# It is not intended to represent the runtime requirements of any single
# repo. Instead, it defines a curated workspace environment that
# allows multiple tools to be used together.

# These two repos are required for profiling workflows, but are not
# yet merged into their respective main branches. We therefore install from
# the relevant feature branches.
